## Pasteable Meta-Eval Prompt (for GPT/UI)
Copy this along with the table above to evaluate judges and overall quality:
```
You are evaluating a persona-simulation pipeline.
1) Look at 'Pair Summary' (mean scores/latencies) to pick the strongest GEN→JUDGE pairs.
2) Inspect 'Best Candidates' snippets; check persona fidelity, clarity, constructiveness, and locality.
3) Comment on judge consistency using the reported mean σ across judges.
4) Recommend the best GEN model, best JUDGE model, and any prompt/length tweaks.
5) Flag common failure modes (style drift, hedging, policy overreach, verbosity, boilerplate).
Return concise bullets and a ranked list of pairs.
